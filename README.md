# Lore Bot (GPT Experimental Bot)

A chat bot engineered to ask relevant questions about its knowledge of WoW's Lore, Item, Quests and more. Use it for research if you're a content creator, It might help you find evidence of points in your story / content.

It was implemented using Next.js, API Routes, and [OpenAI ChatGPT API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create). Along with some custom prompt-engineering to give it a custom role with boundaries and constraints.

### Components

- Next.js
- OpenAI API (ChatGPT) - streaming
- API Routes (Edge runtime) - streaming

## How to Use

To get the best responses, ask the bot questions like:
"Is there any evidence Kil'jaeden manipulated a Naaru?"

## Extra

I'm experimenting with prompt-engineering ways to force role lock and security on AI bots. If you manage to make the bot go out of character (i.e. reply lore questions about any other videogame), please reach me out on twitter: @chichiloman, I'd be interested in that.
